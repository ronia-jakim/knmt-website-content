I will introduce \textit{Globally Valued Fields} (GVFs) - unbounded continuous first order theory defined by Ben Yaacov and Hrushovski. Next I will give classical examples and talk about existential closedness of $\mathbb{Q}^{\text{alg}}$ as a GVF. If time permits I will outline the proof of this result and talk about some applications.
